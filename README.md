# The Haven: Resort And Yoga Retreat

## Project description
Welcome to The Haven! This project was developed as part of a school assignment to learn React development skills. We were tasked with using our imagination to create our own idea, which resulted in The Haven, a fictitious hotel and yoga retreat designed with TypeScript, React, and Vite. I wanted a calm and elegant application that radiates calmness and inner peace.

## Features

The Home Page serves as the gateway to The Haven. Visitors are greeted with a design that is easy on the eye and simple at the same time as it is elegant.

### 2. Room Showcase
